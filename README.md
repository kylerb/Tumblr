## Tumblr

Leveraging animations and gestures to create custom navigation.

Time spent: 7 hours

### Features

#### Required

- [x] Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
- [x] Compose button should modally present the compose screen.


Two areas of the assignment I'd like to discuss:

1. Setting up arrays .. (for some reason I can't get the fourth and fifth tab icons to deselect when I tap another tab)
2. Custom animations like rotation. I could not figure out the home spinner or bobbing explore tip.
